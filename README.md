# Replication Project Template

A replication of Paxton, Unger and Greene (2011) "Reflection and Reasoning in Moral Judgment" in Cognitive Science

The template contains the replication project template as well as a file called `anonymize.py` that you can run to remove personally-identifiable information from the data exported by Qualtrics. Just run `python anonymize.py` to anonymize all Qualtrics `csv` files in the `data` directory.
